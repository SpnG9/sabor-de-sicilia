  - **Routing**: implemented `react-router-dom` for smooth navigation between different sections of the website
  - **Responsive Design**: ensured the website is fully responsive across various devices and screen sizes, offering a great experience on both desktop and mobile
  - **Accessibility**: focused on making the site accessible to all users, including those with disabilites, by following best practices in semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
  - **Tailwind CSS**: used Tailwind CSS for efficient, utility-first styling to create a clean and modern design


### Technologies Used

  - **React** for building the user interface
